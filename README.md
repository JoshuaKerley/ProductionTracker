# ProductionTracker

This Android app was developed to keep track of production at New Image Thrift Store. It helps collect data throughout the day, and then sends it through Google Forms to a spreadsheet that keeps track of the daily totals.

Note: This repository is missing the FormEntries.java file, which stores the access keys to the Google Form that the data is sent to.
